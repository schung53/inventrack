# InvenTrack

This is my submission for the Shopify Back-End Developer Challenge. It is an interactive inventory tracker for a logistics company, built according to task specs. Along with basic CRUD functionality for inventory items, users can also upload images and generate thumbnails.

## Tech Specs

The API was written with Express and the front-end was created with React/Redux. Items are stored on a MongoDB collection and images and their associated thumbnails are stored on an AWS S3 bucket. 

## Instructions

1. npm install
2. npm start

Or, check out the demo [here](https://shopify-be-challenge.herokuapp.com/).

## Features

- READ: The home page lists the inventory items that have been registered.

- ADDITIONAL FEATURE: Users can also upload images of the items and the app automatically stores images and generates thumbnails with smaller dimensions for faster loading. Thumbnails are considerably smaller in size, making the loading time of the home page negligible.
